INSERT INTO `blog` VALUES (1,'World\'s Oldest Moss May Not Survive Humans','After nearly 400 million years of evolution and resilience, this rare moss is now facing extinction','A rare moss called Takakia has adapted over hundreds of millions of years to survive the extremes of life on the cliffs of the Tibetan Plateau. Now, a team of researchers who have been studying the moss for nearly a decade says that despite being one of the fastest-evolving species ever studied, Takakia may not be adapting quickly enough to survive climate change.\r\n\r\nThe genus Takakia includes just two species, both of which are found only on the Tibetan Plateau—an area the researchers refer to as the “roof of the world.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Dr. Xuedong Li, one of the two first authors of the study, discovered populations of Takakia at an altitude of over 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) in 2005. The team has been studying the moss on-site and in the lab ever since.\r\n\r\nLife on the Tibetan Plateau isn\'t easy. Takakia is buried under snow for eight months of the year and exposed to high levels of UV radiation when it emerges from its snowy cover.\r\n\r\nTakakia has been evolving in this location for over 65 million years, ever since the region was formed by continental drift, making the habitat increasingly extreme.\r\n\r\n“These geological time records help us to trace the gradual adaptation to a life at high altitudes in the Takakia genome,” explains Dr. Ralf Reski from the University of Freiburg, who led the team along with Dr. Yikun He from the Capital Normal University in China. The latest research looked at how the moss has been able how to develop the ability to survive life-threatening extremes.\r\n\r\nIn the study, they also document how climate change has significantly altered the moss\' habitat within just a few years.\r\n\r\nThe team was surprised to find Takakia\'s shape in 165 million-year-old fossils from Inner Mongolia, revealing that genetic changes affecting shape evolved more than 165 million years ago under wildly different conditions.\r\n\r\n“Although the Takakia genome is evolving so rapidly, the morphology has not changed recognisably for more than 165 million years,\" says Reski. \"This makes Takakia a true living fossil. This apparent contrast between unchanged shape and rapidly changing genome is a scientific challenge for evolutionary biologists.\"\r\n\r\nAll told, Takakia is some 390 million years old—and is host to the fastest evolving genes ever discovered.\r\n\r\n“We have now been able to prove that Takakia is a moss that separated from the other mosses 390 million years ago, shortly after the emergence of the first land plants. We were surprised to find that Takakia has the highest known number of fast-evolving genes under positive selection”, says He.\r\n\r\nBut despite having hundreds of millions of years to evolve to increasingly extreme changes, climate change may put an end to the little moss that could.\r\n\r\nSince they began taking measurements of Takakia\'s habitat in 2010, the researchers describe an average temperature increase of almost half a degree Celsius per year. Meanwhile, the glacier near the sample sites is receding at an alarming pace—around 130 feet (50 meters) per year.\r\n\r\nThe researchers note that Takakia populations have become significantly smaller over the study period. Between 2010 and 2021, the coverage of Takakia populations decreased by 1.6% annually, faster than that of four local common mosses—a trend they expect to continue.\r\n\r\n“Our study shows how valuable Takakia is in tracing the evolution of land plants. The population decline we found is frightening,” He says. “Fortunately, knowing that the plant is threatened by extinction also gives us a chance to protect it, for example, by growing it in the lab,” adds Hu.\r\n\r\n“Takakia has seen the dinosaurs come and go. It has seen us humans coming,\" Reski concludes. \"Now we can learn something about resilience and extinction from this tiny moss.\"\r\n\r\n','Environment','Melissa Breyer','PM_Biologie_Takakia_Reski_Takakiapopulation.jpeg','2023-10-20'),(2,'Conservation Groups Sue Utah for Starving the Great Salt Lake of Water','Upstream diversions are putting the West&#039;s largest wetland ecosystem at risk of ecological collapse.','Among the many splendors of the western United States, the Great Salt Lake has long stood out as an iconic jewel. As the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere and the eighth-largest terminal lake in the world, it provides habitat for millions of migratory birds, among other organisms, and supports a variety of industries, contributing billions of dollars to Utah’s economy.\r\n\r\nThe lake receives its water from several rivers and precipitation—but upstream diversions are wreaking havoc on the body of water. Water levels have dropped significantly enough that the lake is poised for ecological collapse as well as impacts on human health throughout the region.\r\n\r\nNow, a new lawsuit says state officials have breached their trust obligations to Utahns by failing to take appropriate and necessary action to address the crisis and protect the lake. \r\n\r\n“The baby steps Utah has taken at the Great Salt Lake are woefully inadequate to sustain the American West’s largest wetland ecosystem, and we need the state to stop ignoring the upstream water diversions that are spiraling the lake and its wildlife into oblivion,” said Zach Frankel, Executive Director of the Utah Rivers Council.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit seeks a court order directing Utah’s leaders to implement meaningful solutions that will provide enough water to the Great Salt Lake for the people and wildlife that depend on it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Salt Lake Tribune, the complaint was filed in 3rd District Court and invokes the public trust doctrine, &quot;claiming the Utah Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has failed in its duty to protect the largest saline ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere for the benefit of its residents.&quot;\r\n\r\nDepleted water leaves sediments exposed, resulting in the potential for fine particulates and toxic pollutants—including arsenic, mercury, and other toxic substances—to be carried into nearby communities.\r\n\r\n“In other parts of the world, where saline lakes have been allowed to shrivel up because of upstream diversions like those happening at the Great Salt Lake, the end result has been public health disasters from the clouds of relentless toxic dust,” said Dr. Brian Moench, President of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. “Utah’s leaders are prioritizing these water diversions over protecting their own people, so the courts must intervene.”\r\n\r\nIn the last three years, upstream diversions for agriculture, residences, and industry have led to a yearly deficit of more than 1 million acre-feet of water, notes a press release from Earthjustice, the non-profit representing the groups. As a result, the group explains, the lake’s elevation recently dropped below the point experts say is necessary for its continued viability.\r\n\r\n“The Great Salt Lake belongs to the people of Utah and the state has a legal obligation to protect this resource,” said Stu Gillespie, Senior Attorney for Earthjustice’s Rocky Mountain office. “But the state has sidestepped that obligation and failed to respond to the crisis facing the lake. Upstream water diversions threaten the lake’s biodiversity, industries that depend on the lake, and human health throughout the region. It is time for Utah officials to address the problem and safeguard this public resource.” \r\n\r\n“The health of northern Utah’s entire population depends on the Great Salt Lake’s survival, and I hope this lawsuit can help save it,” said Deeda Seed, Utah Campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “In addition to the millions of people who live here, so many plants and animals depend on the lake, including 12 million birds from more than 300 species. They make this area unlike anywhere else. The state of Utah’s complete abdication of its responsibility to protect the lake threatens our ability to live in this spectacular region.”\r\n“The Great Salt Lake is of critical global importance for bird species such as the Eared Grebe, Marbled Godwit and Wilson’s Phalarope,” said Michael J. Parr, President of American Bird Conservancy. “We can’t afford to have this significant body of water turn into dust. Water management decisions need to prioritize both water quantity and water quality while balancing the needs of birds, people, and local economies.&quot;\r\n\r\nPolling from this year by Utah State University shows that drought and a drying Great Salt Lake are the top two environmental concerns for residents. And is it any wonder? It&#039;s hard to imagine Utah without the lake.\r\n\r\n“Utahns want to see the Great Salt Lake protected. Unfortunately, our state leaders have repeatedly demonstrated that they aren’t interested in taking meaningful action to address this urgent issue,” said Maria Archibald, Lands and Water Programs Senior Coordinator for the Sierra Club’s Utah Chapter.\r\n\r\n“The Great Salt Lake is central to Utah’s very identity and the lifeblood for many migratory bird species. It must be safeguarded to protect communities from the severe public health, economic, and environmental consequences its collapse would entail.”','Business and Policy','Melissa Breyer','drought-pushes-great-salt-lake-to-lowest-levels-on-record.jpeg','2023-09-06'),(3,'Its Summer Solstice Time — Here is What to Know','Celebrate the 2023 summer solstice with a crash course in curiosities about the longest day of the year.','Its hard to believe that a mere six months ago, those of us in the Northern Hemisphere were grimly facing the shortest day of the year—and now suddenly, the sun is setting at bedtime and the unofficial first day of summer is upon us. How did that happen?! The winter and summer solstices sometimes feel out of whack with the seasons they represent—shouldn&amp;amp;#039;t the longest day of the year be the hottest and occur at the height of summer? Answers to that phenomenon and others are explained below.\r\n\r\n(Note: For the Southern Hemisphere, this is all reversed, thanks to our topsy-turvy world.)\r\n\r\n1. When Does the Summer Solstice Happen?\r\nIn North America, we can revel in the longest period of sunlight in 2023, on Wednesday, June 21, at 10:57 a.m. EDT (or the equivalent in your time zone). This is the precise moment when the sun stands still at its northernmost point as seen from Earth. Its zenith doesn’t teeter north or south but sits patiently at the Tropic of Cancer before switching directions and heading south again. This is where the word solstice comes from; the Latin &amp;amp;quot;solstitium&amp;amp;quot;—from sol (sun) and stitium (to stop).\r\n\r\n2. There Will Be SO MUCH SUNLIGHT\r\nGet your sunglasses out, bare your shoulders, put on the sunscreen! The meteorologists willing, we will have loads of sunlight. In New York City, we will have a soul-affirming 15 hours and 8 minutes between sunrise and set—and add a few hours of light on either end for when dawn actually breaks and darkness descends. (You can check your day length at the Farmer’s Almanac sunrise and sunset calculator, to see what to expect in your neck of the woods.)\r\n\r\n3. The Longest Day Isn&amp;amp;#039;t the Hottest\r\nGiven that the sun passes directly overhead on the solstice—and it&amp;amp;#039;s the day with the most sunlight—one wouldn&amp;amp;#039;t be off-base to think it might claim the highest temperatures as well. But no. As NOAA explains, in the US, temperatures continue to inch up into July. &amp;amp;quot;The temperature increase after the solstice occurs because the rate of heat input from the sun during the day continues to be greater than the cooling at night for several weeks until temperatures start to descend in late July and early August.&amp;amp;quot;\r\n\r\n4. The North Gets Short-Changed on Summer Sun\r\nWhile it certainly may not feel like it, in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer we are actually farthest from the sun thanks to the planet&amp;amp;#039;s tilt; we get 7% less sunlight than the Southern Hemisphere does during their summer. Something we&amp;amp;#039;ll be grateful for in a few billion years (see #7).\r\n\r\n5. Despite the Sunlight, It Was Once a Dark Day for Science\r\nGalileo Galilei strongly supported Copernicus&amp;amp;#039; theory of a heliocentric universe, that the Earth revolved around the sun. For his advocacy of this theory, which went against Catholic church teachings that Earth was the center of the universe, he was accused of being a heretic, among the most serious of crimes. While he was cleared of charges of heresy, he was instructed to no longer espouse the theory. In 1632, he published a book once again promoting the heliocentric theory of Copernicus. And once again he was called before the Inquisition—this time he was found guilty of heresy. He was sentenced to life in prison—according to legend, on the day of the summer solstice of 1633.\r\n\r\n6. It&amp;amp;#039;s a Day of Celebration\r\nThe solstice has been such a vastly important day throughout history that it would be impossible to list all the significant celebrations here. From Stonehenge on, the day is more-so-than-not marked by revelry—including no shortage of libations, nudity, dancing in the woods, costumes, parades, bonfires, and general merrymaking.\r\n\r\n7. The Future of the Summer Solstice is Bright. Really, Really Bright\r\nThe gifts of the sun have been a cause for celebration for millennia—and as it turns out, based on models of stellar evolution, the sun is about 40 percent more luminous today than it was when the Earth was born some 4.5 billion years ago. And it doesn&amp;amp;#039;t look like it&amp;amp;#039;s going to slow down. Scientists estimate that in another 1 billion to 3 billion years, the sun’s looming intensity will &amp;amp;quot;boil away Earth’s oceans, turning our planet into an endless desert.&amp;amp;quot; In which case, the winter solstice will surely become the day to frolic naked in the forest.','Space','Melissa Breyer','__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__treehugger__images__2018__06__Solar-System.jpeg','2023-06-19'),(4,'Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough Could Deliver Clean Power Too Cheap to Meter','Is this a Wright Brothers or Zephram Cochrane moment that changes everything?','The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) accomplished what\'s being called the holy grail of fusion research: It achieved fusion ignition. In other words, it managed to get more energy out than it put in ... sort of. There\'s not much of it, but it is still a big deal.\r\nIn a press conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said, “This is one of the most impressive feats of the 21st century.” She then compared it to the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk and noted, \"But we’re not yet ready for a transatlantic flight.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the LLNL, it achieved what it calls a \"scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it.\" Researchers have been trying to do this since the 1950s.\r\n\r\nTwo major approaches have been used in fusion research. The most popular is the tokamak, or magnetic confinement, where strong magnetic fields confine hot plasma in the shape of a doughnut continuously at low pressure. None have achieved breakeven.\r\n\r\nThe other approach, theorized shortly after lasers were invented in the 1960s, was to fire big lasers at a target for short periods at high pressure. According to the LLNL, \"This revolutionary idea became inertial confinement fusion, kicking off more than 60 years of research and development in lasers, optics, diagnostics, target fabrication, computer modeling and simulation and experimental design.\"\r\n\r\nIn the current experiment, the researchers used the National Ignition Facility (NIF), which was developed for bomb research. In what sounds like the \"Atoms for Peace\" programs in the 1950s, they turned 192 high-powered ultra-violet lasers toward a pellet of deuterium and tritium–isotopes of hydrogen—about the size of a pencil eraser—compressing it and creating a high-temperature, high-pressure plasma that imploded and ignited the fusion reaction.\r\n\r\nThe blast lasted 100 trillionths of a second and heated the target to over 3 million degrees Celsius. According to the LLNL: \"LLNL’s experiment surpassed the fusion threshold by delivering 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output, demonstrating for the first time a most fundamental science basis for inertial fusion energy (IFE).\"\r\n\r\nThat\'s a difference of 1.1 megajoules (0.3 kilowatt-hours), about what it takes to boil a kettle of water. It also is \"scientific energy breakeven,\" where they measure the energy output of the lasers but not the input energy it took to fire up the lasers, which is considerably more. That\'s the \"engineering energy breakeven,\" which must be reached to make fusion practical. They also have to figure out how to do this 10 times a second.\r\n\r\nGranholm is not alone in considering this a Wright Brothers or Zephram Cochrane—the inventor of warp drive on \"Star Trek\"—moment. Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist who has written about the effort to achieve fusion, told the Financial Times that “if this is confirmed, we are witnessing a moment of history.\"\r\n\r\nMcKinley is probably getting a little ahead of himself here. Michael Bluck of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London agreed that this is a big deal, but told The Guardian that the output of the experiment was “high speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating – none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We’ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.” He concluded, \"They’ve sort of solved the physics issues, and now they’re looking squarely at the engineering issues.\"\r\n\r\nIn the current experiment, the researchers used the National Ignition Facility (NIF), which was developed for bomb research.

Granholm says, \"‘This is game-changing, world-improving, lives-saving history unfolding in real-time.\" But it takes time to commercialize new technologies. We are a long way from Mr. Fusion of \"Back to the Future.\"\r\n\r\nMany are writing that this might solve climate change, but commercial fusion is still decades away, and our carbon emissions are happening now. Some, like Bill Gates, don\'t think that matters. In his book \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" he wrote that we should forget about 2030 targets and think big and plan for “the big technological changes that would ensure long-term success.” All kinds of technophiles will point to fusion and say we don\'t have to worry anymore; technology will save us. Before the week is out, someone will say that fusion can be used to make hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAs transport researcher Guilio Mattioli notes, the breakthrough is already being used as an excuse to oppose low-carbon policies and technologies. We are going to see a lot more of this; We have seen it before as self-driving cars were used as an excuse to kill transit, and hyperloops were invented to kill high-speed rail. This could easily be turned into what critic Evgeny Morozov called \"technological solutionism.\"\r\n\r\n','Technology','Lloyd Alter','targetChamber.jpeg','2022-12-14');
